R3tagger is a work that will develop into a fully automated tagging solution
for users of popular file formats. The tagger will use musicbrainz and acoustid
to fingerprint and recognize songs and to correctly tag them. Albums will
handle cases where tracks cannot be identified by fingerprinting using a
custom algorithm (outlined in UseCases.txt) to attempt using existing tags to
recognize a song. Should that fail, the program will attempt to find the
significant parts of the file path to identify the song. I may throw in
Last.fm recognition as well to supplement the musicbrainz system. Additionally,
the program shall have the capability to find album art online and attach it
to songs.

Testing framework can be found under tests/

Immediate plans can be found in thoughts/

The models are complete and under test. A controller has been started and is
wholly under test. An interface to musicbrainz has been created and is mostly
under test. A Backoff decorater resource has been created to handle the query
restrictions posed by the musicbrainz api.
