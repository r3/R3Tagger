R3tagger is a work that will develop into a fully automated tagging solution
for users of popular file formats. The tagger will use musicbrainz and acoustid
to fingerprint and recognize songs and to correctly tag them. Albums will
handle cases where tracks cannot be identified by fingerprinting using a
custom algorithm (outlined in UseCases.txt) to attempt using existing tags to
recognize a song. Should that fail, the program will attempt to find the
significant parts of the file path to identify the song. I may throw in
Last.fm recognition as well to supplement the musicbrainz system. Additionally,
the program shall have the capability to find album art online and attach it
to songs.

Testing framework can be found under tests/

Immediate plans can be found in TODO and notes.txt

The status of the project: Data models representing Songs and Albums have been
created and have testing (using PyTest). I'm now creating a mock of the future
musicbrainz interface so that work can begin on the controller module. Once the
controller module is able to identify songs by looking up a fingerprint and
editing the file's metadata, I'll replace the mock with a real interface to
musicbrainz. The controller is under active construction as well.
