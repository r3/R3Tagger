R3tagger is a program that will develop into a fully automated tagging solution
for users of popular music formats. The tagger will use musicbrainz and acoustid
to fingerprint and recognize songs and to correctly tag them. Albums will
handle cases where tracks cannot be identified by fingerprinting using a
custom algorithm (outlined in UseCases.txt) to attempt using existing tags to
recognize a song. Should that fail, the program will attempt to find the
significant parts of the file path to identify the song. I may throw in
Last.fm recognition as well to supplement the musicbrainz system. Additionally,
the program shall have the capability to find album art online and attach it
to songs. The tagger will be capable of reorganizing music collections based on
configuration.

Testing framework can be found under tests/

Immediate plans can be found in thoughts/

All that remains for the tagger to be feature complete is implementation of the
actual recognition algorithm (musicbrainz and acoustid calls are already built),
and the user interface to be designed. The GUI is currently being built in Qt. I
expect it to be complete within the month.
