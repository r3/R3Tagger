# Ideal Situations

File has 'artist' and 'album' tags:
    Query MusicBrainz for album with artist argument
    Ensure match of albums
    Update local files

Fingerprint exists
    Recognition is high and existing tags roughly match
    Update local files

File has 'album'
    Query MusicBrainz for albums by that title
    Iterate through album results
    Attempt to match album by either existing tags or track count
    Update local files if match found

File has 'artist'
    Query MusicBrainz for albums by that artist
    Iterate through album results
    Attempt to match album by either existing tags or track count
    Update local files if match found


# Failure to match existing tags or fingerprint,
# Attempt to match from path

Read in path of each song in Album
Attempt to parse with priority being placed on low-level path segments
    Tokenized as strings delineated by certain punctuation and numbers
    Four digit numbers shall be tokenized "Year"
    Two digit numbers shall be collected and matched against a range(len(Album))
        Tokenized as "TrackNumber"
    Variable length strings shall be compared
        Matches across the album shall be tokenized "Artist/Album"
        Strings that do not match between tracks shall be tokenized "Title"

# Parsing complete, search for matches
    Search for Artist/Album token values as Album titles in Musicbrainz
        Iterate over each album artists and attempt to match with
        other Artist/Album tokens. Loop over each Artist/Album until
        match is found or tokens exhausted.

    Search for Artist/Album token values as Artist names in Musicbrainz
        Iterate over each artist and see if other Artist/Album tokens
        match the artist's album set

    Search Title tokens (if possible!)
        Iterate over results to see if album or artist is in
        Artist/Album token set

----------------------------------
Ideas
==================================
Lexer/Parser style construct for "from path" recognition
Build fuzzy match recognition into Album class
Allow Albums to be instantiated using musicbrainz results
    Factory class method that could be used to instantiate albums in results
Use Musicbrainz Albums to match against local Albums, return 0.0 to 1.0
Allow a matching threshold to be specified


----------------------------------
Localized Musicbrainz API
==================================
find_album(album=None, artist=None): List of Albums instantiated from results
    get_album:
        id = find_album_id -> lookup_album_id(id)
find_artist(album=None, artist=None):
