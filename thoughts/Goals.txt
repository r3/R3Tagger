IMMEDIATE GOALS

    ConfigParser
I need to get a configuration up sooner than later or
I'll continue to have hardcoded defaults in my source. I'd
rather remove these to a config file where they can be
changed and better tested.

    Tune Queries and Agent Strings
Queries can be amped up, particularly since testing now no
longer requires querying the remote Musicbrainz API.
Create an agent string for the queries.

    Integrate Tagging
Should the actual action of changing a file's tag be taken by
individual Track objects, or in the Controller? I'm thinking
that the Track will handle manipulation of the file it 
represents, acting as a proxy object to that file. The
Controller will instigate tagging changes. Unless I can think
of a better design.
