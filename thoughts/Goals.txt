IMMEDIATE GOALS

    Path Manipulation
The algorithm for grabbing path stuff is done a lot.
It would be useful to build a helper function to take
care of this kind of thing.

                Use :: desired path
    ========================================
    _set_album_path :: /path/to/album/ | song.ogg
    rename_album    :: /path/to/ | album/song.ogg
    rename_tracks   :: /path/to/album/song | .ogg  # in sub func

Since this is common in many libraries, perhaps make a
path manipulation library.

    Class Grabbing
Grabbing 'Album._supported_files' through
'instance.__class__' is getting tiresome. Examples of use:

    Controller.rename_album
    Album.match
    Track.Track.__init__
    Track.Track.__setattr__
    Track.Track.__getattr__
    Track.Track._connect_to_file.determine_type

    ConfigParser
I need to get a configuration up sooner than later or
I'll continue to have hardcoded defaults in my source. I'd
rather remove these to a config file where they can be
changed and better tested.

    Tune Queries and Agent Strings
Queries can be amped up, particularly since testing now no
longer requires querying the remote Musicbrainz API.
Create an agent string for the queries.

    Untested Functions
My Musicbrainz library has functions that are not under test:
_find_title{,_{artists,releases}}

            Fix it.

    Documentation
Documentation is starting to fall behind. Let's get up on that
Maybe figure out Sphinx and keep some docs built for the public
APIs.

    Lucene isn't just Icecream
Album searches (a relatively weak point) could be vastly
improved if I could provide an artist too. Figure out Lucene
searches and enable them in the interface of Musicbrainz.

    Refactor into Query
Refactor the Musicbrainz library into an instance of a Query.
The Query will be a superclass providing a set public interface.
Subclassing Queries (like Musicbrainz) will follow this contract
exactly. For now, just use what's public in Musicbrainz. From
there, attach it as a generic "Query" that can be used by the
controller. Now is a good time to do that since it isn't
integrated yet. From there, we can create other Queries like
an API for last.fm which can be used as an alternative.

    Integrate Tagging
Should the actual action of changing a file's tag be taken by
individual Track objects, or in the Controller? I'm thinking
that the Track will handle manipulation of the file it 
represents, acting as a proxy object to that file. The
Controller will instigate tagging changes. Unless I can think
of a better design.
