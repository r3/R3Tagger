IMMEDIATE GOALS

    ConfigParser
I need to get a configuration up sooner than later or
I'll continue to have hardcoded defaults in my source. I'd
rather remove these to a config file where they can be
changed and better tested.

    Tune Queries and Agent Strings
Queries can be amped up, particularly since testing now no
longer requires querying the remote Musicbrainz API.
Create an agent string for the queries.

    Create the algorithm
I need to start recognizing music. Starting this process will
show me where the holes in my APIs are so that I can build things
out.
