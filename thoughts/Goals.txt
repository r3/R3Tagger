IMMEDIATE GOALS

    Tune Queries and Agent Strings
Queries can be amped up, particularly since testing now no
longer requires querying the remote Musicbrainz API.
Create an agent string for the queries.

    Create the algorithm
I need to start recognizing music. Starting this process will
show me where the holes in my APIs are so that I can build things
out.

    Build GUI
Interacting with the tagger through the interpreter is not the best
way of doing things. I'm in the process of building a GUI using Qt4
and PySide.
