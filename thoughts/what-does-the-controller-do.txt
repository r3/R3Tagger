The controller builds album objects.

Has a library for album/track recognition.
# TODO: Build recognition! That'll be easy!

Has a config file that supplies settings.

The controller manipulates those album objects:
    * Rename files

    rename(target, pattern=None):
        """Renames the target (either Album or Track) according to that
        resource's associated tags, as specified in the pattern. If the
        pattern is not specified, one will be retrieved from the config
        file, or a default will be used.
        """
        if isinstance(target, Album):
            _do_albumy_stuff
        elif isinstance(target, Song):
            _do_songy_stuff
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Target should be an Album or Song")

    * Edit tags
    * Supply information about an album or track
    * Find suitable album art
    * Use the music recognition library to find tags
