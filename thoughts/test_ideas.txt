Musicbrainz.get_album with Album and Artist

Simulate errors (503 & 404) for each low level query.
    Subclass musicbrainz2.webservice.WebServiceError
    in a new mock. In another test class, inject the
    new error throwing mock and test each query function
    against it. The infinitely recursive retrys will
    need to be fixed.

Curry tests to allow tests to run on actual musicbrainz2
library by changing ENV VAR.

Fingerprinting in Track isn't tested. That shouldn't be hard.
Same with Track.supported_{fields,filetypes}
